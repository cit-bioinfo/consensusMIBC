Description: Transcriptomic predictor of muscle-invasive bladder cancer consensus subtypes. 
    It implements a nearest-centroid single-sample transcriptomic classifier based 
    on Pearson's correlation between each sample transcriptomic profile and 
    centroid transcriptomic profiles from the six muscle-invasive bladder 
    cancer consensus subtypes described in Kamoun et al (to be published).
